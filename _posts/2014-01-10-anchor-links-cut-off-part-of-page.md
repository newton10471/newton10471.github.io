Today I'm stumped by a problem very similar to the one described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8016673/anchor-link-cutting-off-the-page-based-on-height-of-absolute-positioned-element). I guess I need to read more about CSS containers, positioning, etc., like maybe starting [here](http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101). After a little more research, [Learn CSS Positioning in Ten Steps](http://www.barelyfitz.com/screencast/html-training/css/positioning/) and the [Mozilla Developer Network article on Positioning](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/position) look promising as well.
