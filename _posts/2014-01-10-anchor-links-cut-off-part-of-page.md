Today I'm stumped by a problem very similar to the one described [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8016673/anchor-link-cutting-off-the-page-based-on-height-of-absolute-positioned-element). I guess I need to read more about CSS containers, positioning, etc., like maybe starting [here](http://alistapart.com/article/css-positioning-101).
