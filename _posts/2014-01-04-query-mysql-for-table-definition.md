Saw from [this post](http://forums.mysql.com/read.php?10,993,1021#msg-1021) that you can query MySQL to get an SQL-formatted table definition using SHOW CREATE TABLE, or if you just want index information, use SHOW INDEX FROM. In the context of my work this comes in very handy on a day-to-day basis, especially when looking to add a column or field to an existing table.
