I'm currently enrolled in a [Coursera course entitled "Learning to Learn"](https://class.coursera.org/learning-003), about how to maximize one's effectiveness in learning through use of proven, research-backed study methods.  The following are some of the key topics and/or study methods, which I have begun to use myself and which I think are particularly suited to my own situation and to anyone hoping to ramp up their skills in web development, or in any technical or non-technical subject:

##### Procrastination, and The Pomodoro Method

I was first introduced to the Pomodoro Method a few years back when I picked up this book: [The Pomodoro Technique Illustrated, by Staffan Noteberg](http://www.amazon.com/Pomodoro-Technique-Illustrated-Pragmatic-Life/dp/1934356506/).  The book gives an introduction to the Pomodoro Method, and in successive chapters details a very thorough and analytical approach to using it to maximize one's productivity.  It seemed immediately useful but the author's approach presented a way of looking at it that seemed, frankly, like a lot of work.

The Pomodoro Method is introduced and reinforced in the class as primarily a way to avoid procrastination, through emphasis, in part on "process rather than product."  It's presented in its most basic and essential form, which is more or less to work in timed (25 or so minute) periods, followed by 3-5 minutes of reward.  This can be tremendously beneficial despite the method's apparent simplicity.  I liked this better than the treatment in Noteberg's book, because it was clear from the instructors' presentation that many people had already found this simple approach to be a useful means to get past one of biggest productivity-killers, that of procrastination.

##### Einstellung

_Einstellung_ refers to being blocked on a problem because of thinking about it the wrong way.  I encounter this problem on a daily basis in my job as a junior, "still-in-training" web developer.  When I get stuck on a technical issue, there are often times a number of different paths I can take to try to get past the current hurdle, and each path can diverge in a totally different direction.  If I pick the wrong path, I can end up in the weeds for _hours_ on a tangent that may have nothing to do with the actual solution to the problem.  When I ask more seasoned coworkers for advice on how to solve a problem, my questions are most often something along the lines of "I don't want you to give me the answer, I just want you to let me know if I'm on the right track or not."  The goal there is to be sure that I'm not totally off base and wasting my own and/or the company's time, or that of my coworkers.  The message of the course on this particular issue seems to be that when solving complex problems such as the type I'm describing, it can often be beneficial to step back for a moment (using the "diffuse" mode of thinking) and make sure that I'm reasonably on the right track, taking a look at the big picture and not too stuck in the weeds to miss that I might be on a tangent in the wrong direction.

##### Illusions of Competence

In my own attempts to learn a number of topics - details of historical events, a new foreign language, or a technical subject like web development are just a few examples - my default mode has always been to consume as much information as possible about the subject, either through reading books or articles, or watching online videos.  I think the reason for this is that it's _easy_, and for me it's a lot of fun.  It was clear, however, even going back as far as high school, that I retained very little of what I read or saw, particularly once the test was over, and that whatever I retained tended to fade away over time with disuse.  The "Illusions of Competence" chapter in [Barbara Oakley's book](http://www.amazon.com/Mind-Numbers-Science-Flunked-Algebra/dp/039916524X) as well as the video lecture on the Coursera site confirmed and validated my thinking that things like repeated readings, lecture-style presentation of new subjects to students was not the best way to learn a new subject and to retain it for future use.

##### Spaced Repetition

The idea of going back to a subject a little bit each day, through habit, rather than doing marathon study sessions for hours or days at a time, is known as "spaced repetition."

I've known about this since as far back as the 4th grade.  I remember my teacher showing the class how to take a piece of ruled paper, fold it in half the long way, write a list of words we were supposed to learn for the week on the left side, and the definitions of each on the right side.  This way it was very easy to just keep the paper folded, and while reading the words line by line on the left side, try to recall their definition and then check every once in a while to confirm whether we'd learned it properly or not.  As with some of the other techniques discussed in the course, it seems too simple to be as effective as it is.

The downside of this "manual" on-paper method is that you would spend a lot of time, unnecessarily, going over words you already knew.  With something like automated [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) flashcards that are available today, you can avoid the overhead of studying for things you already know, and spend time where it's best of use, on the things you still need to learn.

I've used Anki before with varying success, depending on my motivation level to learn a particular subject.  One thing the course emphasises is that it's important to write flash cards out by hand.  This means that to use Anki most effectively, you should write the flash cards out by hand, then take photos of them and upload the pictures to an automated system like Anki, or just keep them somewhere readily accessible like your phone.

##### Conclusion: Why On-the-job Training is a Very Good (Maybe the Best) Way to Learn

Where I work there is a lot of emphasis on on-the-job training, and just throwing people with little or no experience in their new job in the middle of things so that they either sink or swim.  I had always figured that it was a quirk of the corporate culture, or a way to avoid spending lots of money on training as had the previous company I worked for, but now I think there's much more to it than that.  Given the emphasis in the course on doing the activity one wants to learn, rather than reading or watching lectures about it, it seems to me that on-the-job training is probably the best way to get someone up to speed as quickly as possible to quickly achieve competence in their new role.  This is reinforced by my own experience of nearly 20 years as an IT professional: I took a lot of courses in college and graduate school, and learned a lot of high level concepts and theory, but didn't really get my feet wet in gritty details or practical, marketable skills until I was 6 months or so into my first job.  I find that the same happens over and over as I move into new roles in my career, and most recently, as I transitioned a little over a year ago into the job I have now as a web developer.
