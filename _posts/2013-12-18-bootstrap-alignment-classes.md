It turns out that Bootstrap provides alignment classes, in order to easily realign text to components: class names are text-[left|center|right].  This is an easy way to do 'Bootstrapy' text alignment and maintain properly aligned text sitewide and in a uniform manner.  Official Bootstrap 3 documentation on this is [here](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-emphasis), under the 'alignment classes' heading.
