I've been doing web development in a semi-professional capacity for about 6 months.  The hardest part of what I do now on a daily basis is watching my teammates contribute something on the order of 5-10 times of my work output on a regular basis.  What I'm struggling with now is best captured by [this post](http://www.meetup.com/hackerhours/messages/61919332/) last week to the NYC Hacker Hours Meetup mailing list, which included the following:

>The most important thing for a dev to learn is how to work through those seemingly impossible problems without help, i.e. debugging and research skills, and learning how to think about programming problems.

>It can speed you up if someone walks you through the hard parts, but it will also hinder your drive/learning/problem-solving skills if someone else solves your problem. The ideal is two people at similar experience levels pushing each other along.
