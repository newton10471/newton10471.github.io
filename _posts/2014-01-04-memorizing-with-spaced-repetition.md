[This post](http://sivers.org/srs) on Derek Sivers' blog focuses on a very effective technique for memorizing anything, but which particularly helpful in the context of learning a new programming language. The thinking here runs contrary to much of what I was taught as a kid (e.g., rote memorization isn't learning), which is probably a good thing, since I didn't feel like my formal pre-college education was nearly as effective as it could have been.

UPDATE 2014-01-16: There's some other great spaced-repetition resources by [Jack Kinsella](http://ie.linkedin.com/in/jackkinsella), first at [Janki Method](http://www.jackkinsella.ie/2011/12/05/janki-method.html) and an update two years later at [Janki Method Refined](http://www.oxbridgenotes.co.uk/articles/janki_method_refined). Also, [Piotr Wozniak](http://www.wired.com/medtech/health/magazine/16-05/ff_wozniak?currentPage=all) is the best-known researcher in spaced repetition learning theory.
