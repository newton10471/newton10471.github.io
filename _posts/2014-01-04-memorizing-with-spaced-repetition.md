[This post](http://sivers.org/srs) on Derek Sivers' blog focuses on a very effective technique for memorizing anything, but which particularly helpful in the context of learning a new programming language. The thinking here runs contrary to much of what I was taught as a kid (e.g., rote memorization isn't learning), which is probably a good thing, since I didn't feel like my formal pre-college education was nearly as effective as it could have been.
