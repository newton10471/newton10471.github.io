A coworker pointed out two great resources yesterday: [Sandi Metz's Rules for Developers](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers), and [Thoughtbot's Guides](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides). The first outlines four simple and straightfoward rules for coding applications in an object oriented language. The second is a more extensive set of documents on multiple aspects of the software development lifecycle and working in a team: Protocol, Code Review, Best Practices, and Style.
